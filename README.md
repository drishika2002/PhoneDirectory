# PhoneDirectory_Mini-Project

## PROBLEM- STATEMENT: Implementation of Phone Directory using hashing. 

### INTRODUCTION: 
<p>In this project, a phone directory has been implemented using hashing in C++ programming 
language. Here, the type of hashing used lies under open hashing i.e., chaining. Hashing is 
one of the best techniques for the implementation of phone directory because it is one of the 
fastest searching techniquesand one of the main functionalities of a phone directory involves 
searching.</p>
<p>When searching for an element in the hash table, in the best case, the element is directly found at 
the location indicated by its key. So, we only need to calculate the hash key and then retrieve the 
element. This is achieved in constant time. So, best case complexity is O(1). Worst case complexity is
O(n).</p>

We have: Space Complexity: O(nm) => O(n) 
Where, m is the size of the hash table (here, m = 26) and n is the number of items inserted.

### FEATURES: 
Features of the Phone Directory are as follows: 
* To insert new records in the directory
* To remove any existing records
* To modify the name of user
* To modify the phone number of user
* To search for any record
* To display all the records in alphabetical order to make searching easier

### SCREENSHOTS:

*	INSERTION OF DATA:
* DISPLAYING DATA
* SEARCHING FOR A RECORD
* DELETION OF RECORD
* MODIFICATION OF DATA
